ok so you want to have a watchparty

like a really big watchparty

you got a bunch of streams but no way to watch all of them

sure theres holodex for youtube streams

and yes you have teamstream for twitch streams

but is there a way to combine them both?

honestly idk about before i was too lazy to do my research

anyway now there is!

with this (bad) project you can (eventually) watch multiple twitch and
youtube streams at the same time on one site

well for now you can only watch youtube streams and you need to edit the source
code to change it but im still working on it ok

coming soon(ish):

- offline message for youtube streams that are offline
- stream adding without editing code
- stream removal without reloading site
- url query parsing to determine which youtube streams to add
